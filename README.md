Steam Invite Spam Filter
==============

This program is designed to minimize the amount of Steam community invite "spam" that many users have been experiencing.  You can configure the program to either reject all invites or to reject only those invites from profiles of a certain level or lower.

This application is "Early Access"!  You may encounter bugs, which you can [report here](https://github.com/jshackles/Steam_Invite_Spam_Filter/issues).
